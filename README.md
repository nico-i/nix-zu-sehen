# My NixOS configuration

## How I want to setup my Nix configuration

This configuration is made up of two parts:

1. `/hosts/` - This directory contains the configuration for each of the hosts that I want to setup. Each host has its own configuration file.
2. `/modules/` - This directory contains all configurations I use as nix modules. The idea is to use the modules I need in each host configuration.

## Programs I want to install

I aim to use the minimal amount of programs that I need to get my work done. Here is a list of programs that I want to configure:
